# Churn-project
Customer churn is a SaaS business metric that measures the amount of customers, accounts, contracts, bookings, etc. that a business has lost over a period of time. Also known as the rate of attrition or just plain “churn”, customer churn is one of the most widely-tracked and heavily-discussed subscription company metrics. 

* The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict if a customer will leave the business (churn risk score =1) or will stay (churn risk score = 0).
* we will apply different classification algorithms, and then we'll compare and choose the best one of them as our final model.
