# Churn-project
Customer churn is a SaaS business metric that measures the amount of customers, accounts, contracts, bookings, etc. that a business has lost over a period of time. Also known as the rate of attrition or just plain “churn”, customer churn is one of the most widely-tracked and heavily-discussed subscription company metrics. 

In this project, we used the data of a telecommunication company in order to do an explorative data analysis and to apply a model that can predict if a customer is going to leave the business or not. 
* The data consists of the following variables : 
<br>
**age** Represents the age of a customer 
<br>
**gender** Represents the gender of a customer
<br>
**security_no** Represents a unique security number that is used to identify a person
<br>
**region_category** Represents the region that a customer belongs to
<br>
**membership_category** Represents the category of the membership that a customer is using
<br>
**joining_date** Represents the date when a customer became a member
<br>
**joined_through_referral** Represents whether a customer joined using any referral code or ID
<br>
**referral_id** Represents a referral ID
<br>

**preferred_offer_types** Represents the type of offer that a customer prefers
<br>
**medium_of_operation** Represents the medium of operation that a customer uses for transactions
<br>
**internet_option** Represents the type of internet service a customer uses
<br>
**last_visit_time** Represents the last time a customer visited the website
<br>
**days_since_last_login** Represents the no. of days since a customer last logged into the website
<br>
**avg_time_spent** Represents the average time spent by a customer on the website
<br>
**avg_transaction_value** Represents the average transaction value of a customer
<br>
**avg_frequency_login_days** Represents the no. of times a customer has logged in to the website
<br>
**points_in_wallet** Represents the points awarded to a customer on each transaction
<br>
**used_special_discount** Represents whether a customer uses special discounts offered dd

* The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict if a customer will leave the business (churn risk score =1) or will stay (churn risk score = 0).
* we will apply different classification algorithms, and then we'll compare and choose the best one of them as our final model.
